# Welcome to Kai documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and
developing Kai. This tool lets you interact with Gemini models through a
command-line interface.

## Overview

Kai brings the capabilities of Gemini models to your terminal in an interactive
Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. Kai consists of a client-side
application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server
(`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Gemini API and its AI
models. Kai also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing file
system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by
`packages/core`.
